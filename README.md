This rest API is aimed at providing last seen time stamp info of a person when 
we have their last visited time stamp.

Hence we have put in some sample info in app.yml file -
4 persons namely - a,b,c,d and their last visited times

This program computes the last seen time stamp based on the person name passed, 
that is viz a/b/c/d

If you want to test this out, run the program, hit the following GET end point
http://localhost:8080/activities/v1/last_seen_data/{person_name}
Response is a json object which has both last seen crux, tick.
crux -> Simple time stamp lapsed
tick -> Exact time stamp lapsed

If you want to try fresh, replace a person name, time stamp in the 
configuration file in the same order. 

Tech Stack Used:

Java 8

Spring boot 

Gradle 5

Junit 4.12

Points to note:

> Have the same count of persons, time stamps as this program assumes it to be
  a 1-1 mapping. 

> Sample time entered should be of the format yyyy/MM/dd HH:MM:SS

> Time zone is assumed to be local always.

> As we are not using an in memory (h2) or permanent data base sample data is 
fed through the config file.

> In case if we want to deploy this code to any Open source cloud platform like k8s, 
have added drone, docker image files. Of course repo, cert paths i have assumed to be 
from reliance.
